It is literally your only purpose! Walking onto buttons! How can you not do the one thing you were designed for?<p>Oh, that's funny, is it? Oh it's funny? Because we've been at this for twelve hours and you haven't solved it either, so I don't know why you're laughing. You've got one hour! Solve it! </p></span> </div></div><p>Wheatley decided to try to make a test chamber. He made a nice test chamber, but there was only one detail absent — cubes.</p><p>For completing the chamber Wheatley needs $$$n$$$ cubes. $$$i$$$-th cube has a volume $$$a_i$$$.</p><p>Wheatley has to place cubes in such a way that they would be sorted in a non-decreasing order by their volume. Formally, for each $$$i \gt 1$$$, $$$a_{i-1} \le a_i$$$ must hold.</p><p>To achieve his goal, Wheatley can exchange two <span class="tex-font-style-bf">neighbouring</span> cubes. It means that for any $$$i \gt 1$$$ you can exchange cubes on positions $$$i-1$$$ and $$$i$$$.</p><p>But there is a problem: Wheatley is very impatient. If Wheatley needs more than $$$\frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2}-1$$$ exchange operations, he won't do this boring work.</p><p>Wheatly wants to know: can cubes be sorted under this conditions?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.</p><p>The first line contains one positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$), denoting the number of test cases.
